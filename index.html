      <p>I am currently a third year Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati, Class of 2019. For now,
        this site will serve as a main hub where I can document my experiences and further experiment with web technologies.
         Though still exploring opportunities in the field, I have taken a keen interest in web development. My main focus has been with front-end in particular, but
         I am looking to build off of my current knowledge to gain a better understanding of full stack developement as a whole. During my free time, I can be found competing
         out on the volleyball court or shopping around to enhance my personal style.

      <p>I spent the summer of 2016 working at Siemens PLM Software in Milford, Ohio. The team that I was added to was tasked with working
         with one of Siemen's software programs called NX. The majority of the semester was split between functional testing of NX and
         examining error logs and call stacks. Functional testing was performed by navigating the interface of NX looking to find a flaw.
         Once a flaw was found, an error log was generated and the next step was to use the log to determine the source of the error.
         Though there were still occasions when a log was presented to me, and I needed to reproduce the error. I also worked on a project
         with another co-op to write C++ autotests for a number of test cases. These test cases were added to the already existing library of
         tests and were used to ensure regressions were not encountered.
      </p>
      <p>My first co-op position was at Assurex Health in Mason, Ohio. This was the first time I experienced a real working environment
        along with being assigned real world projects. My responsibilities for this rotation were split between Quality Assurance and
        Product Development. I spent the first half of the semester in Quality Assurance where I was to write C# autotests. These autotests
        were then run in combination with NUnit to ensure that regressions were not accidentally added back in to the production website.
        Automating test cases relieved the strain of manual testing from the QA team and allowed them to shift their focus to other matters.
      </p>
      <p>I spent the second half of the semester working in the Product Development team. For this portion, my responsibilities shifted and
        I mainly dealt with implementing fixes on the production web portal. This required me to become more familiar with the C# codebase and how to
        properly use CSS and JavaScript in a professional environment. I also spent a decent amount of time working on a project with another
        co-op to implement logic to recognize customer orders that were associated to each ot
