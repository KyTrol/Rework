      p I am currently a third year Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati, Class of 2019. For now,
        | this site will serve as a main hub where I can document my experiences and further experiment with web technologies.
        |  Though still exploring opportunities in the field, I have taken a keen interest in web development. My main focus has been with front-end in particular, but
        |  I am looking to build off of my current knowledge to gain a better understanding of full stack developement as a whole. During my free time, I can be found competing
        |  out on the volleyball court or shopping around to enhance my personal style.

      p I spent the summer of 2016 working at Siemens PLM Software in Milford, Ohio. The team that I was added to was tasked with working
        |  with one of Siemen's software programs called NX. The majority of the semester was split between functional testing of NX and
        |  examining error logs and call stacks. Functional testing was performed by navigating the interface of NX looking to find a flaw.
        |  Once a flaw was found, an error log was generated and the next step was to use the log to determine the source of the error.
        |  Though there were still occasions when a log was presented to me, and I needed to reproduce the error. I also worked on a project
        |  with another co-op to write C++ autotests for a number of test cases. These test cases were added to the already existing library of
        |  tests and were used to ensure regressions were not encountered.
        
      p My first co-op position was at Assurex Health in Mason, Ohio. This was the first time I experienced a real working environment
        | along with being assigned real world projects. My responsibilities for this rotation were split between Quality Assurance and
        | Product Development. I spent the first half of the semester in Quality Assurance where I was to write C# autotests. These autotests
        | were then run in combination with NUnit to ensure that regressions were not accidentally added back in to the production website.
        | Automating test cases relieved the strain of manual testing from the QA team and allowed them to shift their focus to other matters.
  
      p I spent the second half of the semester working in the Product Development team. For this portion, my responsibilities shifted and
        | I mainly dealt with implementing fixes on the production web portal. This required me to become more familiar with the C# codebase and how to
        | properly use CSS and JavaScript in a professional environment. I also spent a decent amount of time working on a project with another
        | co-op to implement logic to recognize customer orders that were associated to each ot
